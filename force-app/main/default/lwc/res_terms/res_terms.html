    <h1>Acura {modelname} Reserve Terms and Conditions</h1> 
    <p>Welcome to the Acura Vehicle Reserve Program ("Reserve Program"). Before you reserve a vehicle, you must carefully review and accept the Reserve Terms and Conditions below. Under the Reserve Program, an Acura vehicle is available for an early reservation to customers who complete the Reserve Program (as outlined below). American Honda Motor Co., Inc. offers you an opportunity to reserve an {modelname} from an authorized, participating Acura Dealer ("Dealer"). By completing the Reserve Program, you will be reserving an Acura vehicle with model year and options to be confirmed by your selected dealer and subject to availability and production restrictions. The vehicle you configure is referred to as the "Vehicle". The Reserve Program offers a unique opportunity to be among the first to reserve an Acura vehicle and finalize a price and order through your selected Dealer as described in the terms below.</p>
    <p>The Reserve Program is <b>NOT</b> a vehicle purchase and it is not a reservation for a particular vehicle. You will still be required to contact an authorized Acura Dealer to discuss final transaction pricing and trade-in, if relevant, arrange any necessary financing, and complete your purchase through the Dealer. Your reservation secures your approximate priority for taking delivery of a vehicle. Participation in the Reserve Program does not guarantee you a vehicle delivery. </p>
    <p>Your reservation does <b>NOT</b> guarantee a set price for a Vehicle. <b>PLEASE BE AWARE THAT DEALER SETS THE ACTUAL PRICE WHICH MAY DIFFER FROM THE MANUFACTURER'S SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE ("MSRP").</b> The MSRP does not include taxes, title, transportation, premium paint charges, other options and other dealer fees and charges. </p>
    <p>
    In order to complete the Reserve Program, you will be required to:
    <br/>a. select a participating Dealer from which to purchase an {modelname}, 
    <br/>b. submit certain information to Acura and your selected Dealer, and
    <br/>c. Pay a refundable reservation fee of $500 ("Reserve Fee") to your selected Dealer via one of the available methods presented by the Dealer.
    </p>
    <p>Under the Reserve Program, after you have successfully completed and submitted the reserve form, you will have priority to either purchase, finance, or lease an {modelname} from the Dealer. </p>
    <p>The Reserve Program does <b>NOT</b> require you to complete a vehicle purchase, finance, or lease. If you change your mind, you may cancel your Reservation by following the process outlined below under the <b>"RESERVATION CANCELLATIONS"</b> section and the Reserve Fee will be refunded to you.</p>
    <p>The Reserve Program is designed to allow you to order a vehicle from Dealer. After you submit your reservation and Reserve Fee, your selected Dealer will contact you to configure the Vehicle. Please note that vehicle option availability may be subject to change. Model year, paint color and other options are not guaranteed and are subject to production or sales restrictions.</p>
    <p>Once you complete the reservation you will receive a "Reservation Number". Please keep this Reservation Number for reference. Your selected Dealer will then contact you to negotiate the price with you and obtain your place in line for your order. Your place in line will be tied to the Dealer. In the event you are unable to complete a purchase through the Dealer, please contact the Dealer to cancel the reservation.</p>
    <p>
